Software to use as soccer scoreboard. When I began to write it was intended for LED video walls that run from its sender card plugged in to computer and only small portion of your
screen is visible on LED screen. Later it was adapted to work with full resolution but it became a real mess and it was boged just to work for few games.
I'm thinking there is probabbly someone that needs this kind of software because I needed it as well and couldn't find even paid versions of it that are good. It needs to be fully
rewritten its huge spaghetti mess. I've used two windows forms one is for control the other one is used as screen area. In screen area there is WPF host. I used WPF user control
because its easier and faster to solve auto scaling with it. Currently application has possibility to track game time, score, it can show team name (1st version) and now instead
of name its team logo and players that scored goal and when they scored it.
Things I will probabbly add over time:
* Substitution screen - when players substitute on main screen area shows up animation with players substitution, also in control panel players that are in game are green,
                        players out of game are red.
* Goal screen - screen that shows players name and minute when he scored a goal and it shows up on main screen for few seconds (it can be set up in settings how long), for
                home team maybe show players picture when he scores.
* Red/Yellow card screen - when players get red/yellow card program shows his name and minute when he got the card.

In software you can see how I intended it to look. List of players for both team each with his number and name (numbers have to be more visible than names because when you watch
the game you only see his number name is hard to see). 

If someone wants to screw around with this software, improve it and make something good out of it contact me at: m.radic225@gmail.com
I would really like to see this software become something better than it is now. I dont have time or enough skill to push it to the end.
